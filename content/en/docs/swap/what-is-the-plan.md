# What is the plan?

The plan is simple, swap the engine and make it road legal, so it can circulate through the Spanish roads.

Going a bit more into detail, this means:

1. Swap existing engine for a 200hp Golf MK5 GTI (BWA) engine.
2. Swap existing gearbox for a 02Q 6-speed manual gearbox.
3. Improve both front near brakes, suspensions and axles.
4. Make a complete body restoration, including a full respray.
5. Restore the interior of the car; dashboard and seats.

All this with a basic premise; externally the car has to be as original as possible, so no body kits or modifications.

Firstly and the most important when starting a project of this type is to have a good specialised car engineer that can certify all changes made on the car are road legal and a workshop that can do the job.

From the beginning, I was lucky to have:

+ **Sergi Lopez (RH+ Homologaciones)**, an engineer specialized in car certifications who, in a very simple and quick way, explained to me what the rules of the game are to be able to make all changes road legal. In addition, Sergi will also be in charge of doing all paperwork required to make the changes road legal.
+ **Marc Perramon (Tallers Marc)**, a mechanic crazy enough to get into this mess, with a lot of experience in mechanics in general and in building custom trickers
