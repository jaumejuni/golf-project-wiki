## Front axle

As previously mentioned in [rules of game](docs/swap/rules-of-the-game), in order to be able to make the engine swap road legal, the size of the front discs and the number of caliper pistons must be at least the same as the donor vehicle.

In the case of the Golf MK5 GTI, the discs are 312x25 mm with a single-piston caliper. After countless hours browsing internet to find the perfect BBK (Big Break Kit), that is, good, nice and cheap, I decided to go for a CEIKA kit; 345x32 mm and 6-piston calipers, a monster!!. But I was wrong twice.

From the beginning I was wondering if I had 17' or 18" wheels, after thinking about it a lot I decided on 17' BBS wheels. At the time of buying the BBK, I had not yet chosen the size of the wheels, so I bought a disc size that was as big as possible and could be mounted on 17" or 18" rims. And I chose 345mm, but these discs fit very tightly on a 17" rim. In fact because of the profile of the 17" rim those discs were rubbing against the rim.

In short, the disks were too big. So I thought of using the 334x32 mm discs from a Golf MK4 R32 with the CEIKA BBK calipers. But for this setup I had to design some custom adapters that Epytec made.

My second big mistake was buying the BBK from CEIKA. Their customer service is terrible, and I certainly would not recommend CEIKA to anyone. Today, if I had to buy a BBK for a Golf MK3 I would do it through Epytec; Golf MK4 R32 discs (334x32 mm) and ZR17 calipers from Porsche Cayenne or VW Tuareg.

To complete the configuration of the front axle, we added the following elements:

+ New coilovers.
+ Epytec drive shafts. It's important to note here that these shafts are compatible with 02Q gearboxes placed in the OEM position, and the kit from Fabless Manufacturing leaves the motor and gearbox in the OEM position, so everything fits ðŸ˜….
+ New sway bar to replace the existing one.

## Rear axle

Luckily, I didn't buy the BBK for the rear axle from CEIKA ðŸ˜…. I have to admit that I was tempted, but in the end, after looking for alternatives, I discovered that my friends at Epytec have a kit that is perfect and much cheaper.

+ 310x22mm discs from the VW Phaeton.
+ Golf MK4 R32 rear calipers
+ Epytec adapter for calipers/discs.

In summary, except for the adapter, standard parts that can be found in multiple online stores.

As a bonus, a sway bar has also been added to the rear axle ðŸ˜€.
