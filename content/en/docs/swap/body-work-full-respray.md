# Body work and full respray

In April 2022, the time came to start disassembling the original Golf engine and prepare the car for the body work and full respray.

In general terms the car was in very good condition, it only had a little rust on the right front wing, the rest was impeccable. And the body shop confirmed it once the panels were removed to start preparing them for respray.

In this case, and following the advice of the body shop, a full restoration of the body including; exterior, engine bay, interior of the doors, wheel arches and plastic moldings was done with a very good results.

The final result is 2 months of work by the body shop and the left and right front side wings changed as the old ones were rusty (quite common in this type of Golf). In addition, some lateral plastic trimming was also changed as it was broken.

At the end of June 2022 the car is back in the workshop with Marc, and it's time to start messing with the mechanical parts.
