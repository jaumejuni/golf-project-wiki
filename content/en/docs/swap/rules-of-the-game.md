# Rules of the game for an engine swap in Spain

First and foremost, this is neither an exhaustive nor an exact list. The regulations are complex and can change. Therefore, as I mentioned before, it is essential to have an specialised car engineer to guide and take you throughout the entire project.

Having said this, the basic rules to be able to certify swaps in Spain are:

1. Intake and exhaust lines must be those of the donor vehicle.
2. Front and rear brakes (diameter, disc and number of pistons) must be at least the same as those of the donor vehicle.
3. The maximum power of the engine that can be installed in the receiving vehicle cannot exceed by 30% the maximum power approved for that chassis. That is to say, in my case the maximum power approved for a Golf MK3 would be the VR6 with 174hp, therefore, the maximum power that the engine of the donor vehicle can have is 226hp. This rule basically leaves me with only one choice between the engines in the Golf MK5 GTI; the 200hp BWA.
4. The mounting points of the engine to the chassis must be those of the receiving vehicle. Furthermore, no changes (bending, drilling, welding, etc.) can be made to the chassis of the receiving vehicle. As an example, the exhaust line of the donor vehicle must be attached to the exhaust mounting points of the recipient vehicle.
5. No less important are the weights per axle. These should not change, although it is true that there is a certain tolerance, which I think is around 5% maximum.

In my case, I have chosen the following elements:

1. 2.0L TFSI BWA 200hp engine from a Golf MK5 GTI
2. 02Q 6 speed manual gearbox from a Golf MK5 GTI.
3. 334x32mm front discs (from a Golf MK4 R32) with 6-piston calipers
4. 310x22mm rear discs with the rear calipers of a Golf MK4 R32.

These items adhere to the basic rules listed above. Surely you will wonder how the engine of a Golf MK5 is fixed to the chassis of a Golf MK3 without modifying it. The quick answer is Fabless Manufacturing, but don't worry because I will go into detail on that later.
