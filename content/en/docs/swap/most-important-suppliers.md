# Most important suppliers used in this project

The list of providers that I have used in this project is quite extensive, so I am only going to focus on the most relevant ones.

## [Fabless Manufacturing](https://www.fablessmanufacturing.com/)

These people are great. They make various engine swap kits for VW Golf MK1/2/3 and VW Corrado. Discovering them was a great luck, and I would recommend them for their service and quality of products. If you're doing a swap on a Golf, this is your place for engine mounts, subframes, and other little extras that are necessary to keep things running smoothly.

## [Epytec](https://epytec.de/)

Another great finding. They sell a lot of adapters for brakes and gearboxes, and if they don't have the adapter, they can make it for you, as in my case. Very good customer service and high quality products. I had to contact them several times for various reasons and the customer service was always very good.

## [Ceika](https://ceika-store.com/)

This was a bad finding. Terrible customer service, although it must be said that for the moment the quality of the products is good, but my experience with them was very bad. My story with them is very simple to explain, due to a communication error from them I had to pay VAT and customs duties twice for a brake kit valued at around â‚¬2,000. Mistakes happen to everyone, but how you manage them is what makes the difference. They simply got rid of the problem.

## [FMIC.eu Performance](https://fmic.eu/)

Another interesting website (it's from Poland) where they sell radiators, intercoolers and other parts. Both the radiators and the intercoolers are of high quality. The service at all times was good, although I did not have to contact them because there was no incident in any of the orders I made.
