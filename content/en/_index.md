# Swap a Golf MK5 GTI TFSI engine into a Golf MK3
This wiki explains the full project to swap a Golf MK5 GTI engine (engine code BWA) into a Golf MK3 GTI. In addition to that it also explains how to make it road legal (in Spain) and all the challenges I had to overcome to make it work.
There is plenty of cusom fabrication to fit the engine and all the tubes around, but by far the most comlex part is the electrics.

Two different wiring harmesses must work together. From an engine point of view a Golf MK5 GTI (BWA) wiring harness must be adapted to work within a Golf MK3; different ABS, speed sensors, etc. In adition the original Golf MK3 clusters are kept, so engine speed, VSS and other signals must be adapted to make sure the cluster continues displying the right information.
