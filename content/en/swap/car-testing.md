# Car testing

## First test

The engine was fired up for the first time on June 2024. After that a lot of work on hydraulics had to be completed; steering and brakes. In addition and to make the things more interesting the slave clutch cylinder failed (it was completely new!!!) and the union between the engine and the gearbox was leaking. As a result the engine and the gearbox had to be put down and the slave clutch cylinder replaced by a new one. Plenty of work, however we took that opportunity to ensure that everything was properly assembled to avoid further surprises.

After a lot of work on hydraulics, electrics and the problem with the gearbox, the car from a mechanical point of view was completed by beginning October 2024. After testing the steering and gearbox with the front wheels up in the air, and checking that everything work, it was time to do the first test; driving forward and backwards in the garage.

Keep in mind that the car has not gone through MOT like inspection (ITV in Spain) for the last 3 years and the engine has been modified, so the car for the moment is not road legal, so it cannot be tested on the street for the moment. Because of that we had to do the first test within the garage.

The idea once the body shop finishes the car in th following days, is to take it to a closed road for testing and see how it behaves. For the moment we are really exited to see the car moves.
