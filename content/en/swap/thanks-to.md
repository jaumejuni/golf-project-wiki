# Special thanks and contact information

## Special thanks

It's hard to imagine this project without the support and understanding of my wife, Michaela, as for many, many nights after bedding our kids, I stayed in front of the computer doing research work.

In addition to her, I also want to thank a lot for the time and patience that Marc (mechanic) and Sergi (an expert in car certifications) have dedicated to me, without them I would not have been able to carry out this project.

Here are the contact details of these 2 great professionals in case they can be of help to you in the future.
