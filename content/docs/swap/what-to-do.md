# What to do with a car over 25 years old?

I bought this car (my first car); a Golf MK3 GTI, in 1996, and I have always had a special affection for him. I have made many trips with him and have enjoyed unforgettable moments, but now I have to decide what to do. Thinking about it quickly, there are 2 simple answers:

1. Retire him with full honors for services rendered.
2. Restore him so it looks like in showroom condition.

After thinking about it during a trip with my daughter to the Pyrenees in Lleida in August 2021, I decided to restore it, but with a twist. Keeping it as it is now is not an option, it would be like watching a good friend slowly fading away.

As standard the Golf MK3 GTI only has 115hp, which was a reasonable number at the time, but I've always thought this car is underpowered; in fact it is one of his biggest criticisms.

On some occasions it has crossed my mind to swap the engine and put something with much more power, therefore why not a Golf MK5 GTI (BWA) TFSI engine with 200hp. Those TFSI engines can be tuned very easily; increase power, reprogram the ECU, change injectors and turbo or upgrade many parts of the engine, where the sky is the limit. But let's not go crazy, the objective s to carry out the swap with the original 200hp BWA engine, so the car can be road legal in Spain.

All this is not fast or cheap, in fact it is much cheaper to buy a second-hand Golf MK5 GTI. And in terms of time at the moment, I've been there for more than 18 months and I haven't finished yet, but I'm having a lot of fun.
